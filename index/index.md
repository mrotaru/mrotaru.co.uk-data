## About

I've been writing web applications for about 6 years, full stack for the most part. I've worked with with both start-ups and larger companies, in a variety of industries - such as media, gaming and finance. One of the exciting aspects of being a software developer is getting to know these different industries from the inside, an opportunity to explore the different cultures. I'm available starting 16th of September, so [drop me a line](mailto:mihai.rotaru@gmx.com) if you're interested in working together.
